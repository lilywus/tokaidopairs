# Fifty-three Pairings for the Tokaido Road Project
A translation and partial transcription project for the *53 Pairings for the Tokaido Road* (1845-46) print series by woodblock artists Utagawa Hiroshige, Kunisada (signed Toyokuni) and Kuniyoshi.

I first worked with this series for separate Japanese art history and pre-modern language course final projects during my last semester of college, and aim to complete full translation some day! While these translations are by no means of professional quality, I hope to gain more experience with parsing pre-modern Japanese and translation.
